      FolderJump gives you easy access to your favorite folders. This script is based on DirMenu.ahk by Robert Ryan. However it has been modified specifically to work with Directory Opus 11 and Windows 10 and there are a few extra features added to boot!

      Clicking middle mouse button (or pressing win + a) while hovering over certain window types will bring up a custom menu of your favorite folders. Upon selecting a favorite, the script will instantly switch to that folder within the active window. 
      
      Holding down the Shift key while clicking the middle mouse button will bring up the menu regardless of which window the mouse is over. The folder in this case will be shown in a new Explorer window.

      By default, The following window types are supported:
      - Standard file-open or file-save dialogs
      - Explorer windows
      - Console (command prompt) windows
      - The Desktop
      - Directory Opus 11

      A GUI is also included to reorder or change the folder paths 

      !!!! Please change the openPathinDopus variable to 0 if you are not using directory opus
